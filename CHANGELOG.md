# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Purge Command**: Implemented the previously stubbed `purge` command. It now correctly identifies orphaned assets, respects `maintenance_keep.txt` and `--keep` patterns, and safely moves files to a timestamped `.maintenance_trash` folder with an automatically generated `MANIFEST.txt`.

### Fixed
- **Output Encoding**: Corrected a bug in `utils.py` where the UTF-8 fallback wrapper failed to reassign `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` on older Windows systems, ensuring Unicode-safe console output.
- **MCP Stdio Deadlocks**: Resolved "silent hangs" in Cursor by isolating subprocess stdin (`DEVNULL`) and disabling streaming logs (`ctx.log()`) during active execution.
- **Windows Performance**: Defaulted to in-process execution for MCP tools, making them near-instant on Windows and bypassing shim/wrapper overhead.
- **Asset Creation Defaults**: Assets created without an explicit `parent_path` now correctly default to the project root (mirroring GameMaker IDE behavior).
- **Invalid Room Schema**: Fixed invalid JSON generation for room `.yy` files by ensuring all 8 view slots include required fields (`hborder`, `objectId`, etc.).
- **FastMCP Parameter Conflict**: Renamed `constructor` parameter to `is_constructor` in `gm_create_script` to resolve internal naming conflicts in FastMCP.

### Changed
- **Project Root Resolution**: Standardized environment variable support across MCP server and CLI tools. Both now consistently check for `GM_PROJECT_ROOT` followed by `PROJECT_ROOT`, improving consistency when running in different environments.
- MCP tools now default to `skip_maintenance=True` and `maintenance_verbose=False` for faster feedback loops.
- `gm_maintenance_dedupe_resources` now defaults to `auto=True` to prevent interactive prompt hangs.
- Removed legacy `test_mcp_streaming_runner.py` in favor of the more stable direct/non-streaming architecture.
- CLI test suite now imports `gms_helpers` directly from `src` and uses module invocation, removing legacy shim modules.
